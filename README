# Simulation Automation Tool

This project is a small simulation and automation tool for exploring
PID control of a simple thermal system.

It provides a REST API to run simulations, evaluate control performance,
and experiment with controller parameters. A Jupyter notebook is included
to demonstrate analysis and visualization.

## Features
- First-order thermal system model
- PID controller with actuator limits and anti-windup
- Performance metrics (overshoot, IAE, settling time)
- Parameter sweep for controller tuning
- Notebook-based plots and comparison

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
